     * This method is invoked by the thread that executed the task. If

     * or {@code Error} that caused execution to terminate abruptly.
     * <p>This implementation does nothing, but may be customized in
     * subclasses. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses
     * should generally invoke {@code super.afterExecute} at the
     * beginning of this method.
     * <p><b>Note:</b> When actions are enclosed in tasks (such as
     * {@link FutureTask}) either explicitly or via methods such as
     * {@code submit}, these task objects catch and maintain
     * computational exceptions, and so they do not cause abrupt
     * termination, and the internal exceptions are <em>not</em>
     * passed to this method. If you would like to trap both kinds of
     * failures in this method, you can further probe for such cases,

     * or the underlying exception if a task has been aborted:
